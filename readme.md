# DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout Analysis using YOLO, OpenCV, and Python

This project takes works on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm, OpenCV, and Python to analyze data from the DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout. The primary aim is to detect and track soccer players and the ball in video footage.

## Introduction

The project is based on a tutorial video on YouTube which demonstrates how to utilize YOLO, OpenCV, and Python for sports analysis. The DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout provides a rich dataset ideal for testing and developing computer vision models for sports analytics.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect players and ball in the video.
- **Tracking**: Track the movement of detected objects across frames.
- **Analysis**: Perform analysis on the detected objects to gain insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Ultralytics
- Supervision
- YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 weights and configuration files
